- Updated meta charset from `iso-8859-1` to `UTF-8`
- Added proper viewport meta tag for responsive design

### 2. CSS Migration and Organization
- Extracted inline styles from HTML `<style>` block to external CSS file
- Created `public/styles/banking-portal.css` with modernized CSS
- Maintained all original styling including colors, fonts, and layout

### 3. Asset Organization
